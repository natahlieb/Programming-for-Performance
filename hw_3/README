code should be compiled using ./make

In each c file, there are sections to uncomment
code so that either scalar or vector approaches are
taken to each respective problem. Also included are two
lines which will print out the respective arrays before
and after the desigated operations on them were performed.

Seg faults are occuring on problem 1 when a vectorized 
approach was taken. This seems to be some sort of an error
in vectors being added or stored; a solution was not found. 
Data alignment was checked and confirmed.
