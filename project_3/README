Description of Files:
----------------------
CSRGraph.* : files used to help create the CSR graph of our incoming data
Util.* : holds various utility functions
Main.cpp: holds all scheduling implementations 
compile.sh: compile script

How to Run Various Dijkstra Scheduling Implementations:
-------------------------------------------------------
Code is compiled using the compile.sh script; invoke as you would a normal
executable file.

In Main.cpp, one can adjust what graph should be used to run the various
Dijkstra implementations on. The adjustment should be made in the main 
function towards the end of the file. Simply give it the file name. 

The executable created by the compile.sh script is named "proj3". Invoke
this executable to run all dijkstra sssp scheduling implementations.
